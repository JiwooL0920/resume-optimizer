# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

I want to create a resume optimizing webb app using AI.
User will login, and they will upload their resumes in the settings
then in the main page, they can choose which resume to use
and then they can enter job description url
it will ask AI model (they can choose which model to use, and provide their own API key in the settings), and then it will create a preview page with the optimized version newly created by AI to fit the job description and increase their chance of getting noticed by HR.
user can toggle button to keep the generated resume within 1 page
user can highlight whichever part they want to edit, and can give comments. after adding all comments, they can click 'Edit' button to ask AI again to make changes according to their feedback
once they're happy, the file can be downloaded, and it is auto-saved for the user to retrieve whenever they want
u

This is a resume optimizer project that appears to be in its initial setup phase. The repository currently contains only a basic README.md file with the project name.

## Development Setup

- React frontend with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Redux
- Go backend services with Gin framework (microservices architecture)
- Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts
- Cloud Native PostgreSQL (CNPG) in cluster namespace 'cnpg-system'
- Google OAuth authentication
- Docker containerization for all services

## Commands

### Build
- `make build-all` - Build all services
- `make build-client` - Build React frontend
- `make build-auth` - Build auth service
- `make build-processor` - Build resume processor service

### Development
- `make dev-client` - Start React development server
- `make dev-backend` - Start backend services with docker-compose
- `npm start --prefix client` - Start React app from root directory
- `go run -C services/auth main.go` - Start auth service directly
- `go run -C services/resume-processor main.go` - Start resume processor directly

### Database
- `make setup-db` - Create database and run migrations on CNPG cluster
- Database: `resume_optimizer` on CNPG cluster `postgresql-cluster` in `cnpg-system` namespace
- Connection: `postgres://postgres:password@postgresql-cluster-rw.cnpg-system.svc.cluster.local:5432/resume_optimizer`

### Deployment
- `make deploy-all` - Deploy all services to Kubernetes
- `make deploy-client` - Deploy client to `resume-optimizer-client` namespace
- `make deploy-services` - Deploy backend services to `resume-optimizer-controller` namespace

## Architecture

### Microservices
- **client/** - React frontend with nginx
- **services/auth/** - Authentication service (Google OAuth, JWT)
- **services/resume-processor/** - Resume optimization and AI processing
- **shared/models/** - Common data models
- **shared/database/** - Database migrations and schemas

### Database Schema
- **users** - User profiles and OAuth data
- **resumes** - User uploaded resumes
- **optimization_sessions** - AI optimization requests and results
- **feedback** - User feedback on optimized resumes
- **user_api_keys** - Encrypted user API keys for AI services

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Project structure with microservices architecture
- React frontend with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Go backend services (Auth + Resume Processor) with Gin framework
- PostgreSQL database setup with migrations on CNPG cluster
- Docker configurations for all services
- Kubernetes Helm charts for deployment
- All services tested and running locally

### 🚀 Services Running
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 (React + TailwindCSS)
- **Auth Service**: http://localhost:8080 (Go + Gin)
- **Resume Processor**: http://localhost:8081 (Go + Gin)
- **Database**: `resume_optimizer` on CNPG cluster

### 📋 Next Steps
- Implement Google OAuth authentication
- Build resume upload functionality
- Integrate AI APIs for resume optimization
- Create user interface components
- Add API key management for users

### 🛠️ Development Notes
- Go modules handle dependency isolation (no virtual env needed)
- TailwindCSS configured for Create React App compatibility
- Database migrations ready in `shared/database/migrations/`
- All services have basic CORS middleware configured
